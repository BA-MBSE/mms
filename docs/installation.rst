Installation
============

The MMS, in it's default configuration currently has two main dependencies:
  - Relational Database (e.g. Postgresql, MySQL, etc.)
  - Document Store (e.g. Elasticsearch)

For artifact storage, an S3 compliant object store is necessary. We develop against MinIO and deploy against AWS S3, however, any S3 compliant object store will suffice.
